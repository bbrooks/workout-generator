Like the 7-minute workout, but with the exercise order randomized each time.

Todo:
* Add a selection of background beats
* Add a better UI for playing and pausing
* Add more exercises
* Allow user to customize number of exercises
* Allow user to customize time between exercices
* Allow user to start a new sequence
* Use promises and async/await instead of recursion for sequencing audio
