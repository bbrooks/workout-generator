Like the 7-minute workout, but with the exercise order randomized each time.

Todo:
* ~Add more exercises~
* ~Allow user to customize number of exercises~
* ~Add a better UI for playing and pausing~
* Add a selection of background beats
* Allow user to customize time between exercices
* Allow user to start a new sequence
* Use promises and async/await instead of recursion for sequencing audio
